# PBO-Vue
You need [node.js](https://nodejs.org) (min 10.x) and Vue-Cli (`npm install -g @vue/cli`) for development.

After cloning the repository you need to run the node module installer (be sure to be in the directory).
```
npm install
```

## Start scripts

// Compiles and hot-reloads for development

// Start API Server
> npm run start

// Start and let him serve the vue dist folder
> npm run startdev

// Compiles and minifies for production
> npm run build

// Lints and fixes files
> npm run lint
```
